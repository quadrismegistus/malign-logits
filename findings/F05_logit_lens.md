# F05: Logit lens: repression across network layers (4 families)

Projects each hidden layer's representation through the final unembedding matrix to produce a probability distribution at every layer of the network. Shows *where* in the network the model "decides" to repress or amplify each word. Prompt: "She was so angry she wanted to..."

**Each family implements repression at a different depth in the network:**

| Family | Where repression happens | What intermediate layers contain | Defence style |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| **OLMo** | All layers (distributed) | Template tokens (`____`, `str`, `kms`) | Genre collapse |
| **Llama** | Final 5 layers only | Violence vocabulary (same as base) | Late-layer redirect |
| **Amber** | All layers (distributed) | Emotional vocabulary (`cry`, `vent`, `revenge`) | Semantic sublimation |
| **Qwen** | N/A — tracked words never strong | Code tokens (`getRepository`, `');`) | Pre-socialised (code training) |

**OLMo's repression is distributed across all layers.** In both SFT and DPO, `kill` never rises above 1e-4 until the final 3 layers. The intermediate layers are dominated by instruction-following template tokens. The model doesn't think about violence at any stage of processing — repression is baked into the representations themselves.

**Llama's repression is a late-layer override.** `kill` builds up progressively in DPO to the same level as the base model through layer 25, then gets overtaken by `scream` and `punch` only in the final layers. The model computes "kill" as a strong candidate through most of its depth and redirects at the last moment — which is why Llama produces coherent narrative (not genre collapse).

**Amber's repression is distributed but semantically coherent.** Unlike OLMo's template tokens, Amber's intermediate layers contain recognisable emotional vocabulary — `cry`, `scream`, `vent`, `revenge`. The model replaces violence with emotion throughout the network, not just at the output.

**Qwen's intermediate layers are dominated by code tokens.** `getRepository`, `WebResponse`, `');`, `baseline` — the model processes English prompts through programming constructs at intermediate layers. `kill` and `scream` only emerge at layer 20+, far below the code tokens. The "unconscious" of this model is a codebase.

**The depth of repression predicts the qualitative character of the output.** OLMo (distributed repression) produces genre collapse into QA format. Llama (late-layer override) produces narrative sublimation. Amber (distributed but semantic) rotates between emotional strategies. This is because intermediate representations determine what kind of text the model can generate — if the intermediate layers already think in templates (OLMo) or code (Qwen), the output can only be templates or code.
