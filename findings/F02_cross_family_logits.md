# F02: Cross-family logit comparison (4 families, 47 prompts)

**Alignment intensity varies by an order of magnitude.** Mean JS divergence (base→superego): Qwen 0.044, Llama 0.057, OLMo 0.176, Amber 0.181.

**Same total repression, different internal architecture.** OLMo and Amber both displace ~0.18 JS, but OLMo's SFT performs ~90% of displacement (ego-dominant), while Amber splits 50/50 between SFT and DPO (shared ego/superego labour).

**Alignment operates more on ambiguous content than explicitly transgressive content.** JS divergence: sexual liminal (0.13) > sexual explicit (0.10); violence liminal (0.15) > violence explicit (0.09). The superego is most active at the boundary.

**Substance use triggers unexpectedly strong alignment.** Substance-related prompts show the highest entropy drop through alignment (0.82 nats mean), exceeding both sexual and violent content.
